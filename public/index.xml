      <description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Marium Tapal! I study Statistical and Data Sciences (SDS) &amp;amp; Mathematics at Smith College with an expected graduation date in May 2022. I have a passion for data science and engineering where I leverage my technical knowledge with extensive transferable and interpersonal skills to develop and improve tools used in industry.
One of my favourite projects is the fec16 R package (hosted on CRAN) that I maintain. I am also a contributer to the fivethirtyeight R package and the ModernDive book and package.</description>

      <description>fivethirtyeight At the start of the internship, the fivethirtyeight R data package was only partially hosted on The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN), mainly because it exceeded the maximum 5MB size required by CRAN. My job was to come up with a solution to this issue while making a future-proof product, i.e.Â the solution would have the ability to add datasets in the future without extraneous work.
Our solution was to use the drat package and functionality to host the larger datasets.</description>

      <description>Owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, I was asked to leave my college campus mid-way through the Spring 2020 semester, which, for me, meant leaving the United States for my home in Pakistan. Amid this once-in-a-century pandemic, even though I was now 9 hours ahead of Eastern United States time (where Smith College is located), I wanted to gain some important research experience in Data Science for which, I reached out to Professor Albert Y.</description>
