This project attempts to teach binary classification in unimodal and multimodal memes to my classmates in the Spring 2021 Smith College Modeling for Machine Learning course in under 15 minutes. 

It is based upon the **The Hateful Memes Challenge: Detecting Hate Speech in Multimodal Memes** [paper](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/file/1b84c4cee2b8b3d823b30e2d604b1878-Paper.pdf) by researchers at Facebook AI.

[Here](https://github.com/mariumtapal/hateful-memes-paper) is the GitHub repo for this project. You can view the activity [here](https://github.com/mariumtapal/hateful-memes-paper/blob/master/main.pdf).
