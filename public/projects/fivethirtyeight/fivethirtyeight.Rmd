`fivethirtyeight` is a R data package that provides access to the code and data sets published by FiveThirtyEight. I am a contributor to this package, where I used `drat` to author an add-on `fivethirtyeightdata` package to host the large datasets that were too big for CRAN. I talk more about my work in this blog post [here](http://mariumtapal.rbind.io/blog/summer_internship_2020/#fivethirtyeight).
