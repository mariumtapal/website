      <description> fec16 is an R data package that contains relational data for the United States 2015-2016 election cycle in the form of pre-loaded datasets and functions.
I will be presenting an e-poster about the fec16 package at the Women in Statistical and Data Sciences 2020 (virtual) conference on October 1, 2020 at 10 a.m. EDT.

      <description> fivethirtyeight is a R data package that provides access to the code and data sets published by FiveThirtyEight. I am a contributor to this package, where I used drat to author an add-on fivethirtyeightdata package to host the large datasets that were too big for CRAN. I talk more about my work in this blog post here.

      <description>The ModernDive textbook is a textbook for introductory statistics and data science which is available in print and as an open-source online version. Along with the textbook, there is the moderndive R package which includes data and functions to support the textbook, and a labs website that houses sample problem sets and projects as well as tips and tricks.
My contributions include cleaning up the non-user facing internal R code and text for better reproducibility, simplifying and organizing the labs website for a better user interface, and solving some issues that came up with the moderndive R package.</description>
