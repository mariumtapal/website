`fec16` is an R data package that contains relational data for the United States 2015-2016 election cycle in the form of  pre-loaded datasets and functions.

I will be presenting an e-poster about the `fec16` package at the Women in Statistical and Data Sciences 2020 (virtual) conference on October 1, 2020 at 10 a.m. EDT.
