`fec16` is an R data package that contains relational data for the United States 2015-2016 election cycle in the form of pre-loaded datasets and functions.

I presented an e-poster about the `fec16` package at the Women in Statistical and Data Sciences 2020 conference and at the Electronic Undergraduate Statistics Research Conference.
