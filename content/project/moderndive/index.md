The ModernDive textbook is a textbook for introductory statistics and data science which is available in print and as an open-source online version. Along with the textbook, there is the moderndive R package which includes data and functions to support the textbook, and a labs website that houses sample problem sets and projects as well as tips and tricks. 

My contributions include cleaning up the non-user facing internal R code and text for better reproducibility, simplifying and organizing the labs website for a better user interface, and solving some issues that came up with the `moderndive` R package. I write more about my work [here](http://mariumtapal.rbind.io/blog/summer_internship_2020/#moderndive).
