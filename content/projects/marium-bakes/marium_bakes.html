<p>I have created (currently a WIP) a baking website using <code>rmarkdown</code>, HTML, and CSS, that houses my favourite tried-and-tested recipes. It is hosted via GitHub Pages at: <a href="https://mariumtapal.github.io/marium-bakes/" class="uri">https://mariumtapal.github.io/marium-bakes/</a></p>
