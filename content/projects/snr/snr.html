<p>This project attempts to automate and greatly simplify the process of conducting a Bayesian Simple Normal Regression in R, allowing users to generate an entire report containing a fully customized analysis – including information such as model quality, proposed regression lines, posterior predictions, and more – using only a single line of code.</p>
<p>This project uses a parameterized R Markdown report and a simple function to perform the magic! You can look at the code and read more about it in the GitHub repo <a href="https://github.com/mariumtapal/bayes-regression-report">here</a>.</p>
