This project attempts to automate and greatly simplify the process of conducting a Bayesian Simple Normal Regression in R, allowing users to generate an entire report containing a fully customized analysis -- including information such as model quality, proposed regression lines, posterior predictions, and more -- using only a single line of code.

This project uses a parameterized R Markdown report and a simple function to perform the magic! You can look at the code read more about it in the GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/mariumtapal/bayes-regression-report).
