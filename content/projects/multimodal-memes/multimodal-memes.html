<p>This project attempts to teach binary classification in unimodal and multimodal memes to my classmates in the Spring 2021 Smith College Modeling for Machine Learning course in under 15 minutes.</p>
<p>It is based upon the <strong>The Hateful Memes Challenge: Detecting Hate Speech in Multimodal Memes</strong> <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/file/1b84c4cee2b8b3d823b30e2d604b1878-Paper.pdf">paper</a> by researchers at Facebook AI.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/mariumtapal/hateful-memes-paper">Here</a> is the GitHub repo for this project. You can view the activity <a href="https://github.com/mariumtapal/hateful-memes-paper/blob/master/main.pdf">here</a>.</p>
