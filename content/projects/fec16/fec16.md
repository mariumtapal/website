`fec16` is an R data package hosted on [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=fec16) that contains relational data for the United States 2015-2016 election cycle in the form of pre-loaded datasets and functions.

I presented an e-poster about the `fec16` package at the [Women in Statistical and Data Sciences 2020 conference](https://github.com/mariumtapal/presentations/blob/master/wsds-2020/wsds_2020_poster.pdf) and at the [Electronic Undergraduate Statistics Research Conference](https://rawgit.com/mariumtapal/presentations/blob/master/eUSR-2020/pres.html).
