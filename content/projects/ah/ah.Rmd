Aligned Hierarchies (ah) is an open-source Music Information Retrieval Python package. I am working with a geographically distributed team of 5 people to accomplish the following by August 2021:

- host package on the Python Package Index and on Anaconda.org
- build a documentation website via Sphinx 
- submit a paper to the Journal of Open Source Software.

Once this project is made public, I will add relevant links.
