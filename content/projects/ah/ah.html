<p>Aligned Hierarchies (ah) is an open-source Music Information Retrieval Python package. I am working with a geographically distributed team of 5 people to accomplish the following by August 2021:</p>
<ul>
<li>host package on the Python Package Index and on Anaconda.org</li>
<li>build a documentation website via Sphinx</li>
<li>submit a paper to the Journal of Open Source Software.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once this project is made public, I will add relevant links.</p>
