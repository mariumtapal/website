intro: "Hi, Iâ€™m Marium (she/her). I am an incoming Statistics PhD student at Rutgers University, with an interest in developing statistical tools and methodologies that address real-world problems. I enjoy thinking about statistics and data science pedagogy.
\n\nPreviously, I was a Research Associate at Harvard Business School, where I contributed to the development of research tools at the intersection of data science and organizational behavior. Before that, I graduated from Smith College with a degree in Math & Statistical and Data Sciences.
\n\nOutside of work, you can find me obsessing over coffee, baking all sorts of fun desserts (my [baking website](https://mariumtapal.github.io/marium-bakes/)), reading, crafting, and learning new things. \n\nFeel free to contact me via [email](mailto::mariumtapal@gmail.com)!"
