intro: "I am a Research Associate at Harvard Business School researching and building statistical tools that help people learn about themselves + improve their well-being. I'm passionate about inference techniques that can help solve real-world problems. I also enjoy thinking about statistics and data science pedagogy.
\n\nPreviously, I studied Mathematics and Statistical and Data Sciences at Smith College, a historically women's college in Massachusetts.
\n\nOutside of work, you can find me obsessing over coffee, baking all sorts of fun desserts (my [baking website](https://mariumtapal.github.io/marium-bakes/)), reading, biking, and learning new things.
\n\nFeel free to contact me via [email](mailto::mariumtapal@gmail.com)!\n"
