intro: "\nI am a Research Associate at Harvard Business School where I work with data
  to improve tools that help people learn about themselves. \n\nI studied Statistical
  and Data Sciences & Mathematics at Smith College, a historically women's college
  in Massachusetts. I enjoy thinking and learning about data science, technology advancement,
  open-source, digital design, business problem solving, research, and technical communication
  among other things. You can learn more about my open-source contributions by visiting
  \n\nOutside of work, you can find me obsessing over coffee, baking all sorts of
  the [projects](/project/) tab or viewing my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/mariumtapal).
  fun desserts (my [baking website](https://mariumtapal.github.io/marium-bakes/)),
  reading, biking, and learning new things.\n\nFeel free to contact me via [email](mailto::mariumtapal@gmail.com)
  or on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mariumtapal)!\n"
