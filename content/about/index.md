I am an undergraduate student at Smith College double majoring in Statistical and Data Sciences (SDS) & Mathematics expected to graduate in May 2022. I have a passion for data science and engineering where I leverage my technical knowledge with extensive transferable and interpersonal skills to develop and improve tools used in industry. 

I am an R enthusiast: I co-wrote of the [`fec16`](/projects/fec16.html) R package. This summer, I am working with Professor Albert Y. Kim on improving the [`fivethirtyeight`](https://github.com/rudeboybert/fivethirtyeight) R package and ModernDive book from . I serve as the Data Ambassador of Smithies in Statistical and Data Sciences, a student run orgranization spreading the love of data science.

Outside of data science, I am a House Community Adviser at Smith College Residence Life and the publicity chair for EKTA, the South Asian Students Organization. 

In my spare time, I obsess over aviation, experiment with making brownies and other delicious baked goods, and spend time reading all kinds of books!
