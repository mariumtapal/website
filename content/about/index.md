### Hi, I'm Marium Tapal!

I study __Statistical and Data Sciences (SDS) & Mathematics__ at __Smith College__ with an expected graduation date in May 2022. I am passionate about learning new data science tools and technologies and solving complicated mathematical equations. 

I am an #rstats enthusiast - where I use it for most things in-and-out of school. I am the maintainer of the [`fec16`](https://github.com/baumer-lab/fec16) R package (hosted on CRAN). I am also a contributor to the [`fivethirtyeight`](https://github.com/rudeboybert/fivethirtyeight) R package and the [`ModernDive`](https://github.com/moderndive) book and package. I believe in contributing to open-source resources for the good of society. Recently, I undertook the journey of self-learning Python and SQL. 

Outside of work, you can find me obsessing over coffee, baking gooey brownies, cartooning pictures, reading books, dreaming about returning to airports and airplanes, and talking about languages.

Feel free to contact me via [email](mailto::mariumtapal@gmail.com) or on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mariumtapal)!
