I am an undergraduate student at Smith College double majoring in Statistical and Data Sciences & Mathematics expected to graduate in May 2022. As an R enthusiast, I am the co-author of the [`fec16`](https://github.com/baumer-lab/fec16) R package which is in the process of being released on CRAN. This summer, I am working with Professor Albert Y. Kim on improving the `fivethirtyeight` R package and ModernDive book. I serve as the Data Ambassador of Smithies in Statistical and Data Sciences, a student run orgranization spreading the love of data science.

Outside of data science, I am a House Community Adviser at Smith College Residence Life and the publicity chair for EKTA, the South Asian Students Organization. 

In my spare time, I obsess over aviation, experiment with making brownies and other delicious baked goods, and spend time reading all kinds of books!
