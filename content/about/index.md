### Hi, I'm Marium Tapal!

I study Mathematics & Statistical and Data Sciences at Smith College (a historically women's college in Massachusetts, USA) with an expected graduation date in May 2022. I am passionate about learning new data science tools and technologies and solving complicated mathematical equations. I am looking for full-time opportunities beginning in the summer!

My primary programming language is R. I am the maintainer of the [`fec16`](https://github.com/baumer-lab/fec16) R package (hosted on CRAN). I am also a contributor to the [`fivethirtyeight`](https://github.com/rudeboybert/fivethirtyeight) R package and the [`ModernDive`](https://github.com/moderndive) book and package. I believe in contributing to open-source resources for the good of society. 

I am comfortable working in Python and SQL. During the summer of 2021, I am working with the Smith College Tinker Lab on a Python Package for Music Information Retrieval Aligned Hierarchies called `repytah`.

Outside of work, you can find me obsessing over coffee, baking gooey brownies, cartooning pictures, reading books, dreaming about airports and airplanes, and talking about languages.

Feel free to contact me via [email](mailto::mariumtapal@gmail.com) or on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mariumtapal)!
