### Hi, I'm Marium Tapal!

I study Statistical and Data Sciences (SDS) & Mathematics at Smith College with an expected graduation date in May 2022. I have a passion for data science and engineering where I leverage my technical knowledge with extensive transferable and interpersonal skills to develop and improve tools used in industry. 

One of my favourite projects is the [`fec16`](https://github.com/baumer-lab/fec16) R package (hosted on CRAN) that I co-authored. I am also a contributer to the [`fivethirtyeight`](https://github.com/rudeboybert/fivethirtyeight) R package and the [`ModernDive`](https://github.com/moderndive) book and package. 

In my spare time, I obsess over aviation, experiment with making brownies and other delicious baked goods, and spend time reading all kinds of books!

Feel free to contact me via [email](mailto::mariumtapal@gmail.com) or on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mariumtapal)!

Note: This website is a work in progress, please stay tuned!
