### Hi, I'm Marium Tapal!

I am a recent graduate of Smith College (a historically women's college in Massachusetts, USA) where I studied Statistical and Data Sciences & Mathematics. I am passionate about data science, business analysis, research, and solving complicated mathematical equations. I am looking for full-time opportunities beginning immediately!

My primary programming language is R but I am comfortable in python, SQL, Tableau, LaTeX, and HTML/CSS. 

I enjoy contributing to open-source software. Some of my work includes the [`fec16`](https://github.com/baumer-lab/fec16) R package (hosted on CRAN) about US 2016 election data, the [`fivethirtyeight`](https://github.com/rudeboybert/fivethirtyeight) R data package and the [`ModernDive`](https://github.com/moderndive) book and package for introductory statistics and data science. I also contributed to the [`repytah`](https://github.com/smith-tinkerlab/repytah) python package for Music Information Retrieval.

Outside of work, you can find me obsessing over coffee, baking all sorts of fun desserts, reading books, and talking about languages, and learning new things.

Feel free to contact me via [email](mailto::mariumtapal@gmail.com) or on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mariumtapal)!
